            My name is Robert Xavier Alanis. A fun fact I like to share about myself is that I am a German-Born Mexican-American. (No, I don’t speak German, but I did grow up speaking Spanish).
            My professional background is in education. I was a bilingual fifth-grade teacher for three years in Austin, Texas. I now work at the University of Texas as the Academic Program Coordinator for the Texas Evening MBA. I enjoy this work because it speaks to my love for education and how knowledge has the ability to transform lives for the benefit of society.
            I was drawn to coding because I realize how important technology is in our daily lives. Most of the devices and services we use have some sort of coding. So for me the question was not “why should I learn how to code,” rather I asked myself  “why shouldn’t I learn how to code?” I believe that in the future coding will be essential knowledge that everyone will have to know.
